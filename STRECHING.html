<br/>
<font size="4" fontface="Times New Roman">Stretching is a form of physical exercise in which a specific muscle is deliberately flexed or stretched in order to improve the muscle's felt elasticity and achieve comfortable muscle tone.The result is a feeling of increased muscle control, flexibility, and range of motion. Stretching is also used therapeutically to alleviate cramps and to improve function in daily activities by increasing range of motion.</font>
